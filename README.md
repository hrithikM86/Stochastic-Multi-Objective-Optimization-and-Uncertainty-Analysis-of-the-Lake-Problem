# Stochastic Multi-Objective Optimization and Uncertainty Analysis of the Lake Pollution Problem

## Project Description

This project addresses the lake pollution problem through multi-objective optimization, using **NSGA-II** and **MOEA/D** algorithms to balance environmental and economic objectives. By implementing deterministic and stochastic models and incorporating **Monte Carlo simulations**, the study captures real-world uncertainties, providing a robust framework for decision-making in environmental management.

The results demonstrate that NSGA-II offers diverse solutions across the Pareto front, while MOEA/D effectively finds optimal solutions for specific trade-offs. This project emphasizes the importance of accounting for uncertainty in environmental policy, yielding valuable insights for sustainable management strategies.
