# Stochastic Multi-Objective Optimization and Uncertainty Analysis of the Lake Pollution Problem

## Project Description

This project explores the lake pollution problem through multi-objective optimization, utilizing two algorithms, **NSGA-II** and **MOEA/D**, to balance competing environmental and economic objectives. By implementing both deterministic and stochastic models and incorporating **Monte Carlo simulations**, the study accounts for real-world uncertainties, offering a robust framework for decision-making in environmental management.

The results demonstrate the advantages of NSGA-II for discovering diverse trade-offs across the Pareto front, while MOEA/D excels in finding optimal solutions for specific objectives. This project highlights the importance of uncertainty in environmental policy applications, providing valuable insights for sustainable management.

## Key Features
- Multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II and MOEA/D algorithms
